# monadic

This TypeScript library provides a robust collection of monads to streamline and enhance functional programming. Monads are powerful constructs that encapsulate computational logic, enabling you to compose complex functions in a clean, concise manner. Our library includes commonly used monads such as Option, Either, and IO, each designed to help you manage side effects, handle errors gracefully, and compose functions seamlessly.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Collection**: Includes essential monads like Maybe, Either, IO, and more.
- **Type Safety**: Leverages TypeScript's type system to provide compile-time guarantees.
- **Functional Programming**: Facilitates pure functional programming paradigms.
- **Composability**: Easily compose and chain operations without boilerplate code.
- **Error Handling**: Simplifies error propagation and handling through monadic structures.
